                <p>
                    We are a team of 4 Students who, as a Wildtrack entry in the HackaTUM 2024, decided to create this website together!

                    There was a similar concept in the past called MensaSchmarn that was based on one person's opinion and we wanted to bring this idea back into existence better than ever before. That is why now, provided they can prove that they ordered the meal, ANYONE can leave a review on the Mensa's food!

                    Furthermore we wanted to make it easy to check for other necessary information like the ingredients you could be allergic to, general prices and more, which can all be accessed when you click on the individual meals!

                    We hope this website is helpful to you all when you plan to visit the Mensa of excellence the TUM campus Garching!
